So that's all fun and good. But all of this additional data will need to be gathered, assessed, and cleaned. This is where you come in.
Key Points

Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:

    1. You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the
    dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.
    
    2. Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to
    practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only
    to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.
    
    3. Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.
    
    4. The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This
    unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.
    
    5. You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to
    gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used.
